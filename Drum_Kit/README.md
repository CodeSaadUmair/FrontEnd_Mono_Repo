# 🥁 Drum Kit

The **Drum Kit** project is a simple and interactive web-based drum machine that allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing specific keys on the keyboard or using mouse/touch inputs. Each sound is visually represented by a button on the screen, providing both auditory and visual feedback to enhance the experience.

This project is designed for beginners and enthusiasts alike, helping users learn how to create interactive webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The drum kit is responsive and works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring everyone can enjoy playing with it regardless of their device.

## 🎵 Features

- **Interactive Audio:** Each key on the drum kit corresponds to a different sound. Sounds include clap, hihat, kick, openhat, boom, ride, snare, tom, and tink.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Users can press specific keys (`A`, `S`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `L`) on their keyboard to trigger different drum sounds.
- **Mouse/Touch Input:** Users can also click on or tap the buttons on the screen to produce the same sounds.
- **Visual Feedback:** When a sound is triggered, the corresponding button highlights and grows briefly, providing a visual cue to the user.
- **Responsive Design:** The drum kit adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Audio Reset:** The audio resets each time a key is pressed, allowing rapid sound replay without delays.

## 📂 File Structure

- **`index.html`:** This file contains the structure of the webpage, with buttons corresponding to each drum sound and links to external styles and scripts.
- **`style.css`:** The CSS file defines the visual style of the drum kit, including button designs, animations, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- **`app.js`:** The JavaScript file handles the interaction between user inputs (keyboard, mouse, or touch) and the sounds. It includes functions to play the audio and add visual feedback when a sound is played.
- **`sounds&Image/`:** This folder contains the drum sound files (`.wav` format) and an image used as the background for the webpage.
