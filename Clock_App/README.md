# 🕒 Clock Web Application

A responsive and dynamic **analog clock** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project visualizes the real-time hours, minutes, and seconds, simulating the motion of a traditional clock. It's designed to be simple, clean, and easily adaptable to different screen sizes.

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ **Real-Time Clock Updates:** The clock hands (hour, minute, and second) are animated based on real-time data fetched using JavaScript.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- 🎨 **Customizable Clock Styles:** Hand sizes and colors are easily adjustable through CSS.
- 🧠 **Smooth Transitions:** The clock hands move smoothly, with cubic-bezier-based transitions for a fluid animation experience.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: The structure of the clock interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling the clock, ensuring a flexible and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Updates the clock hands dynamically, synchronizing with the local system's time.


## 📖 Usage

Once the page is loaded, the clock will display the current local time. The second, minute, and hour hands move smoothly, mimicking an analog clock. The app adapts automatically to mobile and desktop screen sizes, thanks to media queries.
