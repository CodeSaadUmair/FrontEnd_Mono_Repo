# 🕒 Clock Web Application

A responsive and dynamic **analog clock** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project visualizes the real-time hours, minutes, and seconds, simulating the motion of a traditional clock. It's designed to be simple, clean, and easily adaptable to different screen sizes.

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ **Real-Time Clock Updates:** The clock hands (hour, minute, and second) are animated based on real-time data fetched using JavaScript.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- 🎨 **Customizable Clock Styles:** Hand sizes and colors are easily adjustable through CSS.
- 🧠 **Smooth Transitions:** The clock hands move smoothly, with cubic-bezier-based transitions for a fluid animation experience.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: The structure of the clock interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling the clock, ensuring a flexible and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Updates the clock hands dynamically, synchronizing with the local system's time.

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CodeSaadUmair/Clock-App.git
